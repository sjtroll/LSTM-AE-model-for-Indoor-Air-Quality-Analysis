# Air-Quality-Anomaly-Detection-Project
Based on the LSTM-AE model for IAQ (Indoor Air Quality) -Neural Network model

Tested with varied hyper parametres to figure out the best-performing model for data given.
This Project is based on the Thesis Project from University of Queensland and the dataset for this project is collected from one of buildings in University of Queensland
